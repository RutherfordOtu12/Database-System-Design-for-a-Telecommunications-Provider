In the sub-Saharan Africa, AIR (fictional company) is a locally based telecommunication provider 
in Ghana. Due to its recent surge in the market, it aims to catch up with profit maximization while 
providing customers or users with top-notch and satisfying services – including customer 
information, service plans, usage data (calls, SMS, data), billing information, network elements, 
and potentially customer support interactions. AIR is therefore faced with the ability to manage 
and regulate large volumes of Customers’ data across various departments. Currently the 
company’s data management systems are accessed and managed on a departmental basis 
(fragmented). Decisions like pricing, customer retention and strategic product advertisement have 
become difficult since customer behavior, service utilization, network efficiency, and billing 
performance are not cumulatively analyzed. Those being made are based on limited analytical 
support. 
AIR therefore aimed to develop a centralized database system using MySQL to integrate various 
specified key business entities from various departments and levels of operation, like customer 
information, service plans, usage data (calls, SMS, data), billing information, network elements, 
and potentially customer support interactions. Specific objectives of this project included:

i. Developing an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram to pictorially and logically represent the 
ecosystem of the company.

ii. Using MySQL to develop a relational database (Schema) called AirDB, that enhance the 
parsing of both standard and complex queries for customer information retrieval, service 
plan management, usage history analysis, billing details, and potentially network 
performance indicators. 

iii. Discuss the application and relationship of the CAP theorem in the context of 
Telecommunication providers.
